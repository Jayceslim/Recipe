        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
        <P>Considering the fact that this is my first website mistakes are expected.
            However, I will try as much as possible to be precise and careful
             during the making process of this site.
        </P>
        <p>Moving on I've been given a task to make a recipe website with each webpage
             containing the recipes for three different dishes I'm farmiliar with. 
        </p>
        <p>I plan on keeping it short as I will be working with this project in future 
                endevours.
        </p>
