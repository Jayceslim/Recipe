This project was done as a test of knowledge and practice for HTML foundation.
I was tasked with making a website for the recipes of 3 different dishes.
This website of mine contains 4 webpages; homepage included.
There are pictures which serve as references for the dishes and links to go back to the previous page and also to the next page of the page you may be in.
There is also a link to the home page.
This project was completed under 3 hours.
I look forward to implementing CSS knowledge into this project.
